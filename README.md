# Schmitt-Trigger-SKY130-design
This repository contains the complete design, simulation, and analysis of a CMOS Schmitt Trigger using the Sky130 PDK. It includes all necessary files—schematic, netlist, simulation scripts, layout (in SCMOS), and waveform snapshots—organized for easy understanding and replication.
